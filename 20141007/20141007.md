## Review
* The lecture tonight is fairly compact, so I'll provide some time a bit later for you to ask some last minute questions related to the syntax
* Keep practicing the skills required to create graphs because you'll need to use it later in the semester

---   

## Loading Data into R
*If you need additional help for the next set of commands you can use `?table`, `?prop.table`, and `?round` to see the help files for each of these commands.


```r
library("foreign"); library("ggplot2")

# Load some data for the examples
yourData <- as.data.frame(read.dta(#
    "http://www.paces-consulting.org/stata/JSU/Fall2014/JohnDoe-task1.dta"))
```

---   

# Describing Nominal/Ordinal Scale Data
* Frequencies tell you the number of observations per category
* You can use the terms proportions and percentages interchangably when describing categorical data since you can only have up to 100% 
* Proportions tell you the ratio of the number of observations in that category compared to all observations
* The marginal proportions give you the proportions for based on the total number of observations per row/column in a cross tabulation
* Sometimes you'll also want to know the number of unique categories

## Describing Intervallic/Ratio Scale Data
### Location
* The mean and the average are the same
* The median is the value in the middle of the range of all the values (e.g., 50%)
* The maximum and minimum are the lowest and highest observed values

---   

### Deviance/Variance
* Variance and Standard Deviation describe how far values are spread from the mean - on average
* The interquartile range is like taking the median from the minimum to median values (e.g., 25%) and the median to maximum values (e.g., 75%)
* The standard deviation is the squared root of the variance; the Variance is the standard deviation squared; this tells you how far the values spread (on average) from the mean

---   

### High Order Moment Conditions

* Skewness indicates whether one tail of the distribution is longer than the other (e.g., whether or not the distribution is symmetrical)
* Kurtosis indicates whether or not the middle of the distribution is too flat or too sharp (e.g., too few observations in the middle or too many observations in the middle of the distribution)
