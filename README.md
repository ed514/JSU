This is the repository for the ED-514 (Elementary Statistics) Course in the College of Education and Human Development at Jackson State University.  

Subdirectories are named with a four-digit year, followed by two-digit month and days respectively.  Students should open files ending in **.md** if they are viewing the slides/documents in their web browser.  However, if the students would like to save the slides to their computer for later viewing, they should download the equivalent file ending in **.html**.  Typically, there will only be a single file of each type per week, but additional files could be included if needed.
